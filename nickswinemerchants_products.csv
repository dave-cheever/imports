The Warboys vineyard is organic and certified biodynamic and is planted adjacent to the cellar door in McLaren Vale.

Dark red core with black tinged edges and a red to dark red hue. Spicy aromas of dark cherries and wild strawberry intermix with graphite, dried herb, forest floor and dried meat notes. Generously fruited yet restrained in its feel, tightly wound flavours of dark to black cherry and strawberry are framed by graphite like tannins. Some earth, dried herb, smoked meat and spice characters ensue. Bright acidity with a long structured finish.
Drink over the next 5-6 years.

29,https://www.nicks.com.au/products/2023-apsley-gorge-vineyard-pinot-noir,2023 Apsley Gorge Vineyard Pinot Noir,"A funky Tassie Pinot that has a meaty feel and a fresh, savoury finish.

Established in 1988 this tiny vineyard is planted to Pinot Noir (5.5 hectares) and Chardonnay (1 hectare) and is located several kilometres inland from the coast near the entrance to the Apsley Gorge national Park north-west of Bicheno. The vineyards unique situation near the entry to the gorge brings breezes in the afternoon which have a distinct cooling effect which means this vineyard is typically one of the last to harvest in Tasmania with harvest usually being around the first week of May.
Since 1999 winemaking has been undertaken by owner Brian Franklin who also does vintage each year in Burgundy with Philippe Charlopin (himself mentored by his friend Henri Jayer) in Gevrey Chambertin, and is helped here in Tasmania by young French winemakers including Philippe Charlopin’s son Yann.
Aged in a combination of new and two year old French oak barrels. Red to dark red core with black shaded edges and a vibrant red hue. Funky yet intense nose with red to dark cherry and strawberry aromas infused with a mix of smoky graphite and dried herb notes followed by some earthy rhubarb and spicy stalk scents. Light to medium bodied, the palate has a meaty flavour profile of cherries, strawberries, earthy graphite, dried herbs, smoked meats and spice. Fine grained tannins concluding fresh and savoury with a meaty feel.

Impenetrable inky black colour with a very deep dark red black hue. Intense liquorice and ripe black cherry scents engulf the nostrils followed by some vanillin oak, whiffs of mocha and peppered earth notes. Rich voluptuous liquorice and ripe black cherry fruits saturate the weighty palate. Vanillin oak, fennel, mocha and peppered earth elements sit in the background. Velvety yet robust tannin structure concluding long, lavishly textured and sumptuous.

The estate’s flagship Shiraz, from their own vineyards in McLaren Vale, this is impressive drinking. Deep magenta in colour, the wine reveals good intensity right from the kick-off. The aromas weave through notes of cloves, vegemite, dark chocolate, cold tea, dried herbs, mulberries and hints of a dusty road. A wine of real intensity, but one which is well balanced and with drive. The oak integration has been competently handled and there is a lingering finish. Enjoy this over the next ten to twelve years. Drink 2025-2037.

32,https://www.nicks.com.au/products/2021-argiano-solengo,2021 Argiano Solengo,"This Super Tuscan was first produced in 1985 and is made from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Sangiovese grapes with maturation taking place in French oak barriques (60% new) for a period of 18 months.
Dense pitch black core with a deep dark red black hue. Alluring aromas of blackcurrant, dark cherry and subtle liquorice infiltrate the olfactory senses complimented by hints of tobacco, vanillin cedar, dried herb and spicy earth notes. Rich and concentrated yet polished and refined the palate is flooded with fleshy blackcurrant, dark cherry and liquorice fruits which are framed by firm, muscular yet integrated tannins. Vanillin cedar, earthy tobacco, dried herb, black olive and spice elements lurk underneath. Outstanding in its power, it finishes very long and deeply fruited with a robust feel.

Fascinating aromas of blackcurrants, orange peel, stone, minerals and blanched walnuts follow through to a medium to full body with firm and polished tannins that deliver a pleasant, caressing mouthfeel. But it requires more bottle age, as expected. This needs two or three years to show more, but it’s already very pretty. Drink after 2026.

This is very Cabernet, with its black currant, blackberry, violet, cedar and sandalwood notes uplifted by vibrant acidity and energetic tannins. Youthful and even a bit awkward now, yet the mineral-infused aftertaste goes on and on. Shows excellent overall balance and detail. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Sangiovese. Best from 2028 through 2042.

Aging took place in older French oak for just a few months. Totally opaque black dark red colour with a dark red hue. Fragrant ripe black currant and dark cherry aromas drift out of the glass followed by some dusty earth, tobacco and delicate spicy cedar notes. Rich blackcurrant fruit carries plenty of weight across the palate with notions of earthy cedar, tobacco and spice lying underneath. Firmish yet nicely integrated tannins provide a sturdy structure and robust feel to the long generously fruited conclusion.

Blackberry with some asphalt and black-cherry aromas follow through to a medium body with firm, polished tannins and a crisp and clean finish. Cabernet sauvignon, syrah, merlot and a splash of sangiovese. Drink or hold.
